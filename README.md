# Wayfarer Back-end
The front-end section for Wayfarer was created by Paris Taylor, Tiffany Teaze, Nassima Bouziane, and Jonathan Jolivette. Our short time spend on this project taught us how to create a react application with node, mongoose, and mongodb primarily. Our application helps travelers catalogue their favorite travel destinations.

## Our Approach and Process
We believe that every great project begins with good planning from start to finish. So, we tracked our projects development in trello: https://trello.com/b/NHSCMc4E/wayfarer-project-product-mgmt-fantastic-4
We began by wire-framing out our database structure, our component and dom tree, user stories, and sprints for each step of the way. We also began by setting up file structures and platforms so we could all start the project with the same tech. 

Our next goal was to psuedo code our backend routes and controllers and seed the database to determine if our json responses were behaving as expected
<br />
After we had rendered everything, we started to implement the CRUD methods onto our front end application. As we worked on our application's functionality, we also paid attention to the styling of the page and structured our grids and responsiveness as we went coded. We used the project sprints as a guideline for what features we needed to include and how users should interact with them.
## Challenges and Wins
Some challenges for us were:
* User validation
* Combining React.js with Bootstrap
* City Container and Profile Container componenets

React.js proved to be the source of a lot of difficulty as we first started this project, because of the top to bottom data flow and React's separation of concerns. It is important to make sure components are independent, but as our application grew, so did the number of files and the information we had to keep track of. Component states and functions often had to be passed down and it was sometimes hard to keep track of everything.
<br />
Finishing the backend CRUD functionality as well as ensuring information persists beyond components changing, were big wins for our team,

Our team worked hard despite the challenges and we're looking forward to continuing this project to polish our approach.
